# CCC-Senior-and-Junior-
These are some of the challenging CCC questions I have been practicing to hone my python skills.
The hard ones are the s3 and s4, they usually require dynamic programming and use graphs or trees
Try and solve before looking at my code, feel free to use it as a guideline, but I highly recommend trying your best to solve on your own
